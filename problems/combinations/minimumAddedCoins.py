# 2952. Minimum Number of Coins to be Added

# Time: O(nlogn) for sorting
# Space: O(1) 

# Greedy Method. Invariant: at i, we have a max range where we can make all sums up to maxRange. 
# When we instantiate, we set max range = 0, sort coins, and start at i = 0. 
# Iterate j from 1 to target. Since we have ranges, every time we get to a coin equal to j, we can add it to our max range. 
# If j is out of the max range, increment the count, and add j to the maxRange.
